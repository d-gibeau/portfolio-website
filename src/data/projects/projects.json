One of the major goals in building this website was to flesh out and improve my frontend skills. Another was to help build out my portfolio of work I could show people. As of this writing the plan is to host this on Netlify. The source code for the project is up on my Github.",

We were evaluated on several different metrics, including performance, correctness, organization, quality, and speed. I used Express.js/Node.js to complete the assessment, with Jest, Supertest, and FetchMock to implement some integration testing. Per their request, I have not included the source code nor the assessment specifications.",
