            <h4>A Little About Me</h4>
            <p>
              I am an avid problem-solver and enjoy finding the most efficient
              solution. Refining code I have written to use as few lines as
              possible and work more efficiently is very satisfying. I am
              fascinated by how things work behind the scenes, both for people
              and for tech. Finding out people's experiences, values and beliefs
              helps me understand where they come from and what makes them tick.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a quick learner and enjoy familiarizing myself with new
              technologies. I am an agreeable person by nature; I get along with
              almost everyone I meet. I am honest and hard-working, although I
              can be somewhat reserved with people I am not comfortable with
              yet. I am equally comfortable quietly working on something by
              myself or in tandem with a tight-knit team of passionate people.
              Remaining adaptable and open to new solutions/experiences is
              valuable to me.
            </p>

              The dog in the picture is Fidel, he is a Havanese Silk Dog. He is
              an old boy; he turned 13 in May of 2021. He still enjoys going for
              walks and is very affectionate. He loves to cuddle. He also is the
              world's best alarm dog, but worst guard dog.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of my hobbies include video games, cycling, and cooking. I
              also enjoy taking Fidel on walks in the neighbourhood. Exploring
              the beautiful River Valley on foot or on my bike is definitely a
              highlight of my summers in Edmonton. I also enjoy cooking simple,
              delicious meals for the people in my life when I have the time.
