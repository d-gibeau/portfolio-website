        <p>I'm a software developer currently based in Edmonton, Alberta.</p>
        <p>
          After nearly a decade of working in the food industry as a line cook,
          I decided to go back to school and switch careers into something I was
          more passionate about. I've always had an interest in computers and
          technology, so software development seemed like a great fit. So far
          it's been pretty fun!
        </p>

          The main purpose of this website is to practice my web development
          skills. It is built in React. I used the "Create React App" tool to
          streamline the process. Some of the styling/layout was implemented
          using Bootstrap.
