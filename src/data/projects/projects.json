One of the major goals in building this website was to flesh out and improve my frontend skills. Another was to help build out my portfolio of work I could show people. As of this writing the plan is to host this on Netlify. The source code for the project is up on my Github.",

    "projDesc": "Less of a personal project and more of a skills assessment. As part of filtering through candidates for a Junior Developer position, they had a timed coding project. We were evaluated on several different metrics, including performance, correctness, organization, quality, and speed. I used Express.js/Node.js to complete the assessment, with Jest, Supertest, and FetchMock to implement some integration testing. Per their request, I have not included the source code nor the assessment specifications.",
